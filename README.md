My old unsolved work for Academy of Science. I upload it here to motivate myself to come back to work.

18.03 - I revived the project. At the begining I want to get same results for the polar and cartesian representation of complex wave function.
19.03 - Still researching. I almost got an alternative approach, but having a trouble with an angle function.
